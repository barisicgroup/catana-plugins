# Catana Plugins repository

This repository hosts plugins for [Catana](https://catana.ait.ac.at/) molecular modelling software.  

## Repository structure
Each plugin is stored in a dedicated repository folder.  
Inside this folder, you can find all what is needed â€“ the plugin files, and a README file introducing plugin usage.

## How to install plugins
There are two basic ways of installing Catana plugins:
1. Open Catana's Command-line interface layout and use the *install_plugin* command with the name of the plugin (without extension) as an argument (e.g., *install_plugin("convert-all-to-aa")*).
2. Download all plugin files and load them into Catana via Plugins menu.

After the plugin is loaded, you can see and run it via the Plugins menu.
