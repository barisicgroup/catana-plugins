# Catana Plugins repository

This repository hosts plugins for [Catana](https://catana.ait.ac.at/) molecular modelling software.  

## Repository structure
Each plugin is stored in a dedicated repository folder.  
Inside this folder, you can find all what is needed â€“ the plugin file(s), and a README file introducing plugin usage.

## How to install plugins
There are two basic ways of installing Catana plugins:
1. Open "Raw" version of the plugin's script on GitHub, open Catana's command-line interface, and use the *install_plugin* command with the script's URL.  
*Example: install_plugin("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barisicgroup/catana-plugins/main/periodic-screenshot/periodic-screenshot.jspy")*
2. Download the script/plugin file and load it via Plugins menu in Catana.
