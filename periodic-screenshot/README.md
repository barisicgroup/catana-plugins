# Periodic Screenshot

This plugin enables to set a fixed time interval in which a screenshot of the current scene in Catana will be taken and downloaded.
Thus, it can be used to easily document the work, backup what was seen in the scene, or to record performed actions later used as an image input for simple animations or movies.

2. Open plugin's modal window (Plugins – Periodic Screenshot) and set your desired settings
3. Press "Confirm" button to change the settings 
4. Press "Start" button to start making screenshots
5. Done :)
    - If you want to stop the screenshots from being generated, press the "Stop" button
    - To change the plugin properties, just modify them in the window and "Confirm" again

## Additional information
The plugin creates two important shared variables in the background:  
1. scr_interval – defines the number of seconds to wait between taking the screenshots  
2. scr_transparent – sets if the screenshot should be taken with the transparent background ("true") or not ("false")
