# How To Contribute

## Adding a plugin
To add a new plugin to the repository, make sure the plugin works correctly, has a valid and unique name and then proceed by creating a pull request. If you do not how to do so, we recommend to follow, for example, [this tutorial by Jake Jarvis](https://jarv.is/notes/how-to-pull-request-fork-github/).

## Discovering problems or bugs
If you encounter some errors or bugs in one of the plugins, please create a new [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/barisicgroup/catana-plugins/issues) documenting the problem. Please make sure to include at least:
- the name of the plugin causing the issue
- description of the problem
- steps that caused it (or, ideally, steps that can be taken to reproduce the problem)
